# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Introduction
Breast cancer is a significant health concern globally, particularly among women. Early detection and accurate prediction of breast cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer based on relevant features extracted from patient data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features such as age, tumor size, tumor grade, and lymph node status, along with binary classifications of whether the tumor is malignant or benign. Access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset?resource=download).

## Notebook Link
Access the notebook on Google Colab: [Breast Cancer Prediction Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mEpYbF2nMAOe19Mugwdgb4KMmbe2WPpE#scrollTo=8SAXd7s6og3g)

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that serves as a comprehensive guide for predicting breast cancer. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training using the Naive Bayes classifier.

## Contents
1. **Introduction**
   - Provides an overview of the problem statement and objectives.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Includes steps for loading the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   
3. **Feature Extraction**
     - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes the dataset to gain insights into its structure and distributions. This includes visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand relationships between variables.
      - **Feature selection/reduction techniques:** Identifies the most relevant features that contribute to predicting breast cancer. This can involve methods like univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, or principal component analysis (PCA).
      - **Feature scaling/normalization:** Standardizes the scale of features to a consistent range, ensuring that no single feature dominates the model training process due to differences in magnitude.
   
4. **Model Training**
     - **Introduction to Naive Bayes classifier:** Provides an overview of the Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence among features.
   - **Training the classifier:** Implements the Naive Bayes classifier using the preprocessed dataset. The classifier is trained on the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between features and target labels.
   - **Model evaluation metrics:** Evaluates the performance of the trained classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. These metrics provide insights into the classifier's ability to correctly classify instances of breast cancer.

   
5. **Conclusion**
   - Summarizes the findings and suggests possible areas of improvement.
